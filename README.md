# Team-Profile-Generator
Pooling employee info quickly to a webpage through inquirer output.

# Testing
> npm test
- features unit tests on the Employee class, and its extensions (Manager, Engineer and Intern)
- can be ran by using the above blockquoted command.

## Features
* prompts to build your team.
* displays neatly and simply within a webpage.
* features links to email and github where appropriate.

## Reasoning
Outputting employee info with links to relevant sites.

## Challenges & Process
1. The recursion between the inquirer prompts took me quite a while to understand, and how to exit it.
2. Generating the HTML was the last step in the process for me, and as such it is lacking in some key features, such as distinguishing between an engineer, intern and manager. However the information still does push to the page, but I didn't want to ask for a second extension so I figured leaving out some of the flair would be acceptable.
